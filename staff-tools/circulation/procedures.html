<h2>Initial setup</h2>
Make sure you are using the correct receipt templates

<h2>Pulling holds for resource sharing</h2>
<ol><li>In Evergreen, click on Circulation menu &lt; Pull list for hold requests</li>
<li>Grab the book from the shelves.</li>
<li>Click "Check in" or "Capture holds" in Evergreen</li>
<li>Scan item</li>
<li>It will prompt you to print a transit slip.</li>
<li>Print the slip and place it in the book.</li>
<li>Put book in a red Linn Libraries bag with the correct library address on front.</li>
<li>Place the bag in the location where the courier will pick it up.</li></ol>

<h3>If the item is missing from your shelves:</h3>
<ol><li>Go to the hold list in Evergreen</li>
<li>Right-click on the item and click "Mark Item as Missing"</li>
<li>If there are any other copies in the consortium, right-click on the item and click "Find another target"</li>
<li>Confirm the message that asks if you would like to reset the hold.</li>
<li>If your library holds more than one copy, the list will ask you to find a different copy within your own library. Otherwise, it will look in other library's holdings.</li>
<li>If there are no other copies in the consortium, and nobody has any plans to purchase any immediately, cancel the patron's hold.  Depending on your library's procedures, you may notify them manually that their hold could not be filled.</li></ol>

<h3>If the item should not be sent per policy:</h3>
<ol><li>Open the item in Item Status</li>
<li>If you have already set the item to transit to another library, choose "Abort Transits" from the Actions for Selected Items menu.</li>
<li>Correct the circulation modifier to one that does not allow resource sharing (e.g. LocalOnly or Video).</li>
<ul><li>If the circulation modifier is correct, send an email to the consortial email list containing the barcodes of both the item and the patron who requested it. This will help us fix any incorrect Evergreen configuration.</li></ul>
<li>Go to the hold list in Evergreen</li>
