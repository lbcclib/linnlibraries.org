title: Circulation policy

<h2>Eligibility for resource sharing</h2>
<p>To be eligible for resource sharing, a patron must be in good standing, which is here defined as:</p>
<ul><li>having a current account at their home library and</li>
<li>not owing more than $5 in fines to any individual Linn Library.</li></ul>

<h2>Restrictions on borrowing</h2>
<p>The following types of items may not circulate to patrons of other libraries:</p>
<ul><li>Certain kits (identified by circulation modifier BIGKIT).</li>
<li>Equipment (identified by circulation modifier EQUIPMENT).</li></ul>

<p>Additionally, each member library may identify certain types of materials that may not be borrowed by borrowers from other libraries. &nbsp;These will preferably be identified by circulation modifier (such as the new LocalOnly circ modifier), but may also be identified by shelving location or item age.</p>

<h2>Renewals</h2>
<p>Patrons may typically renew items borrowed from a library other than their home library at least once, unless the item is needed to fulfill a hold elsewhere in the consortium.</p>
<p>If extenuating circumstances exist, a borrower's home library and an item's owning library are empowered to grant additional renewals to a resource sharing patron.  If the borrower's home library grants such a renewal, they should contact the owning library to apprise them of the situation.</p>

<h2>Fines and fees</h2>
<p>Each loan is subject to the circulation rules of the owning library, including replacement costs, fines, fees.</p>

<h2>Return locations</h2>
<p>Any item returned to and checked in at any Linn Libraries Consortium member by the end of the loan period will be considered to have been returned on time.</p>
