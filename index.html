<p>We are a group of libraries throughout Linn County who work together to provide great library materials and experiences.</p>
<p>Linn County does not currently have a county-wide library system.  While this makes it more difficult for libraries to meet the needs of patrons in our county, the libraries of this group have developed a number of innovative ways to serve you:
<ul>
<li>We provide courier service between select Linn Libraries, so that cardholders can request items from across the county and pick them up at their own local library.</li>

<li>We share a <a href="http://libcat.linnbenton.edu/">catalog</a> between all of our libraries.  Using this catalog, you can find items from libraries across the county with a single click.</li>
<li>We participate in the <a href="http://librariesoforegon.org/passport">Oregon Library Passport Program</a>. If you have a library card at one of our libraries, you can receive a complimentary library card from any other library in our consortium, as well as from other libraries throughout our state.</li>
<li>We provide access and support to numerous databases for research and homework, which have been purchased by the <a href="http://librariesoforegon.org/home">Oregon State Library</a> and <a href="http://www.oregon.gov/SOLL/Pages/index.aspx">Oregon Law Library</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks for taking a moment to learn about our group.  If you have any questions about the Linn Libraries Consortium, please don't hesitate to ask at your local library. </p>
